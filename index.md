### The University of Hull Bioinformatics Lab
We are researchers from across the University of Hull promoting modern reproducible bioinformatics.

Some of the ongoing projects include:

### The evolutionary genomics of reproductive mode
This NERC funded grant between [Dave Lunt](http://davelunt.net) (@davelunt) in Hull and [Mark Blaxter](http://nematodes.org) at the University of Edinburgh. Dr Amir Szitenberg (@szitenberg) was the PDRA in Hull investigating the way in which changes in reproductive mode drive changes in genome content and structure.

### Biodiversity monitoring using eDNA
Projects working with key partners to describe animal communities with genomics.

### ReproPhylo- Reproducible Phylogenomics
[ReproPhylo](http://hulluni-bioinformatics.github.io/ReproPhylo/) is a python environment for phylogenomics giving the researcher tools for large scale data analysis while quietly assuring that the experimental datasets, provenance, and actions are recorded to deliver a reproducible experiment. Amir Szitenberg (@szitenberg) and Dave Lunt (@davelunt) have worked on this.
