The lab is run by Dr Dave Lunt (@davelunt). We work primarily on genomic datasets investigating evolutionary patterns and processes.\r\n\r\nSome of the projects ongoing include\r\n\r\n### The evolutionary genomics of reproductive mode\r\nThis is a NERC funded grant between [Dave Lunt](http://davelunt.net) (@davelunt) in Hull and [Mark Blaxter](http://nematodes.org) at the University of Edinburgh. Dr Amir Szitenberg (@szitenberg) is the PDRA in Hull investigating the way in which changes in reproductive mode drive changes in genome content and structure.\r\n\r\n### [ReproPhylo- Reproducible Phylogenomics](http://hulluni-bioinformatics.github.io/ReproPhylo/)\r\nThis is a python environment for phylogenomics giving the researcher tools for large scale data analysis while quietly assuring that the experimental datasets, provenance, and actions are recorded to deliver a reproducible experiment. Amir Szitenberg (@szitenberg) and Dave Lunt (@davelunt) have worked on this.\r\n\r\n### Evolutionary comparative genomics\r\nSteve Moss (@gawbul) is carrying out a PhD in the lab using bioinformatic approaches to investigate and characterise the patterns and processes of genome evolution.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
